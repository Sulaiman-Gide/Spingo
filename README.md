## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm/yarn installed
- Expo CLI installed globally (`npm install -g expo-cli`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/spingo-react-native-challenge.git
    cd spingo-react-native-challenge
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3. Start the Expo server:
    ```bash
    expo start
    ```

4. Use the Expo Go app on your mobile device or an emulator to view the app.

### Usage

- Once the Expo server is running, you can scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your mobile device, or use an emulator to see the implemented UI.

# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
